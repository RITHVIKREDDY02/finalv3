# IMMEDIATE FIX - Run these commands on your VPS now

# First, find where your app is located
cd /var/www
ls -la

# If you see tashan-win-vip directory, go into it
cd tashan-win-vip

# Stop the current broken app
pm2 delete tashan-win-vip

# Check if you have the fixed files (you should see package-production.json)
ls -la | grep package

# If package-production.json exists, run the fix:
cd dist
cp ../package-production.json package.json
npm install --production
cd ..

# If package-production.json doesn't exist, you need to upload the new fixed zip file first
# Then extract it and run:
# unzip -o tashan-win-vip-final.zip
# cd tashan-win-vip
# cd dist && cp ../package-production.json package.json && npm install --production && cd ..

# Start with the fixed configuration
export NODE_ENV=production
export PORT=5009
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs --env production

# Check status
pm2 status
pm2 logs tashan-win-vip --lines 5
